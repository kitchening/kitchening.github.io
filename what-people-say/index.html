        <p>I can say without a doubt - I will not bother with any other macarons again. Yours were exactly as one hopes they will be.
        Macarons are like a tiny kiss, a promise, a jewel. When made with great care, their little bursts of flavor and texture have the power to transport you somewhere, wonderful, if only for a second. Carly, I thank you for that.

        <p>The thing about your macarons is, there’s no picking one favourite flavour.
        You eat one, go omigod, eat the next, go omigod, and so on, then the box is empty.

        <p>It’s almost mean to give someone one of your macarons; in 2 bites it’s gone, and it’s become this incredible memory. </p>
