      <h4>What we're about</h4>
      <p>Kitchening &amp; Co. is not about macarons. That might be what we do (for now), but it’s not what we’re about. With that being said, here’s what we are about:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Making the best products</strong><br>
        Regardless of what we bake or create, we intend for it to be outstanding. Life is way too short to settle for mediocrity, or to waste eating “average” food. Baking can be long and gruelling work at times, but when you stop and see the facial expression on someone who has just tried one of our vanilla macarons – and you can see their entire world stop before your very eyes – it’s all worth it. More than once we’ve had people tell us that our macarons are the best thing they’ve eaten in their entire lives. There’s nothing more fulfilling than seeing and hearing that people love what you’ve created for them.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Community</strong><br>
        It can be a bit harder to embrace the community aspect of a business without having an actual store / cafe / shop, but nonetheless community is tremendously important to us. Whether it’s volunteering in the community or making meals for friends in need, we want to make a difference and see people living in community with each other.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Relationships</strong><br>
        There’s nothing more important than friends and family, and sharing a meal is the most natural way to bring together the people who are important to you. Whether it’s over bread and cheese, a box of macarons, a pot of homemade soup or a delicious 5-course meal.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Healthy and balanced living</strong><br>
        Lots of people have said to me “you can’t possibly eat your macarons, you’re too fit!”. Nothing could be further from the truth. I taste absolutely everything that leaves our kitchen to make sure that it’s 100% delicious. I also go running. Sometimes I eat whole wheat pasta and sometimes I eat giant piles of fettucini slathered in alfredo sauce. It’s about balance, living and loving life.
        I also believe that we should cook and bake with natural food products. That’s the reason why we don’t use any artificial colours or flavours or any preservatives in our macarons. It can feel limiting at times, not being able to create super bright colours, but that’s the choice we make based on what we believe food should be.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Local</strong><br>
        Working with and supporting local businesses and, as much as possible, consuming food from local sources is another thing that’s really important to us. I think that we’ve really lost touch with where our food comes from, and it’s something that should be important to all of us.

              <hr>
              <p>Carly is a tall, incredibly hard worker who loves thinking up new macaron flavours. She's the type of person that people will spill their heart to, even if she's never met them before. She likes baking, running, hiking and meeting all the great people who love our products.</p>
