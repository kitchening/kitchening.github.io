      </ul>
      </p>
      <strong>Location</strong>
      <p>Typically the Vancouver downtown core, or other areas in Vancouver proper.</p>
      <strong>Responsibilities</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Interacting with potential customers while providing macaron samples at various retail locations, primarily in or around the downtown core of Vancouver.</li>
        <li>Setting up demo equipment prior to the demo.</li>
        <li>Taking down and cleaning demo equipment after a demo.</li>
        <li>A vehicle will be required to transport the various supplies necessary for the product sampling and demos.</li>
        <li>Suitable freezer space will be required to store macaron samples prior to demo (room in a fridge freezer, or in a small deep freeze).</li>
      </ul>
      <strong>About You</strong>
      <p>You have a positive attitude and like to work with people who have the same. You’re a great salesperson, friendly, outgoing and enjoy both learning and educating people about new things.</p>
      <strong>Compensation</strong>
      <p>Hourly, commensurate with experience, but more importantly will be tied to suitability to the position and performance.</strong>
